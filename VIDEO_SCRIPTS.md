### "I Turned Celebrities Into Police Sketches - You Won't Believe The Results"

**[0-30s] Introduction**
"What's up everyone! Today I'm doing something completely wild. I found this AI police sketch maker, and I'm going to test it on celebrities, starting with NFL quarterback Justin Herbert. But first - have you ever wondered what YOU would look like if someone had to describe you to a police sketch artist? Like, would your own mother recognize you? We're about to find out, and the results are going to blow your mind."

**[30s-2min] Explaining the Concept**
"So here's the thing about police sketches - they're not just random drawings. They're based on how witnesses remember and describe people. And our AI police sketch maker uses the same techniques that real police sketch artists use. It analyzes facial features, proportions, and creates a sketch that shows how you'd look through someone else's eyes."

**[2-4min] Justin Herbert Demo**
"Alright, let's start with Justin Herbert. For those who don't know, he's the quarterback for the Los Angeles Chargers, former Oregon Ducks star. Look at this guy - classic all-American look, right? Let's see what the police sketch maker does with this..."

*Show the process step by step*

"Oh my GOD! Look at this! This is actually incredible. The AI captured something about his facial structure that I never even noticed in regular photos. This looks like it could actually be used in a real police investigation!"

**[4-6min] Audience Engagement**
"Now I'm curious - what would happen if I tried this on regular people? Actually, you know what? I want YOU to try this. Imagine showing this to your friends and family. Would they recognize you? Would you recognize them?"

**[6-8min] More Examples/Reaction**
*If you have more celebrity examples*
"Let me try one more... [continue with another example if available]"

**[8-10min] Call to Action & Wrap-up**
"Okay, I am OBSESSED with this police sketch maker now. I've put the link in the description below - I want everyone to try this and show me their results. Tag me on social media, leave your sketches in the comments, whatever. I want to see how different everyone looks as a police sketch.

And here's a challenge for you - get your whole family to try this and see who looks the most different. I guarantee you're going to be surprised by the results.

Don't forget to like this video if you thought the Justin Herbert sketch was as crazy as I did, subscribe for more wild tech experiments like this, and I'll see you in the next one!"
